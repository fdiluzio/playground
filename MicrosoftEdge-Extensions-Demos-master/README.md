# About these demos

This is a set of open source demos for Microsoft Edge extensions.

The goal of these demos is to show some applications of the new Extensions API, as well as help you learn more about developing extensions for Microsoft Edge. We're working on adding more samples and demos. In the meantime, we hope you find these examples interesting and helpful.
